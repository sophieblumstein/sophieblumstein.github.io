  <center><p>SoHo, an acronym for South of Houston Street, has transformed from what was once an industrial squalor, to a vibrant artsy neighborhood that also happens to be one of New York City’s prime shopping districts. In SoHo, you can find luxury boutiques, unique pop-up shops, fun art galleries, chic hotels, and trendy restaurants.

    <center><b><h5>My SoHo</h5></b></center>
    <center><b><p>By Sophie Blumstein</p></b></center>

    <center>

        <p>I first discovered SoHo through the lens of my camera.</p>

        <p>I had to do an end-of-class project for an Introduction to Digital Photography summer course at FIT in 2018 and decided to “focus” on SoHo. I called it SoHo Style.</p>

        <p>I decided to avoid Broadway, to get away from the obnoxious honking of cars stuck in traffic and the swarms of selfie-obsessed tourists, dressed in cheesy  I Love NY ™ t-shirts, walking slower than real New Yorkers and obstructing pedestrian traffic on the sidewalk. As I walked down the narrow cobblestone streets to the east and west of Broadway during my day-long photo shoot, my eyes were drawn to the patterns of the iconic cast-iron buildings; the vibrant retail scene; the hip people in the streets, stores, and restaurants; and the contagious energy of the neighborhood. I realized SoHo is more than just designer fashion, green juices, and pilates. In fact, I think it is unlike any other neighborhood in Manhattan.</p>

        <p>For instance, SoHo is very different from Fifth Avenue. Yes, they are both shopping meccas, but Fifth Avenue is all about global corporate brands and flagship stores, many of them from the likes of LVMH and Richemont. Walking on Fifth Avenue is like walking through the double-page spreads in Vogue magazine.  You could just as well be walking on Bond Street in London, the Champs Elysees in Paris or any major city around the world. Same stores, same people, same vibe. Soho, on the other hand, doesn’t take itself too seriously.  Although Louis Vuitton, Chanel and other luxury brands have migrated downtown, SoHo still has many independent boutiques which, thankfully, in spite of the never-ending gentrification, have managed to survive and thrive. Not only is the retail scene so different uptown vs. downtown, but the people who frequent these neighborhoods are complete opposites. People on Fifth Avenue all fit a certain mold: they are either tourists or elegantly dressed corporate types. People in SoHo, on the other hand, have a unique style and the confidence to pull off any look.  It’s sort of like comparing a conservative up-tight and rational older sister dressed in a black tweed suit to her carefree, spunky, and spirited younger sister.</p>

        <p>I quickly found out, on that Saturday in July, that being a photographer is hard work. Around mid-day, I needed a break and my father—aka the photographer’s (unpaid) assistant—suggested we stop for lunch at what looked like a popular restaurant . We sat in a booth next to a window.  As I was gazing outside, taking in the local scene,  something caught my eye. I saw a woman with a shower cap over her head, aluminum foil over her eyebrows, and tattoos covering her from head to toe. A black sports bra and biker shorts completed the look. I knew I needed a photo of her. She was a prime example of what SoHo symbolizes to me. She would be the star of my portfolio.</p>

        <p>I dashed out of the restaurant, my father looking quite puzzled, and ran across the street to the small hip store she had just entered. I followed her in as calm and collected as possible, feeling like a paparazzi, pretending to admire the cool decor and the edgy garments on the cluttered racks. I hid behind a rack of chunky cheetah-print boots, shooting photo after photo of her looking for the perfect pieces to add to her wardrobe. I couldn't help but chuckle at the sight of her casually shopping while looking like that. However, no one in the store seemed to find her appearance strange. This is what I love about Soho. She might have looked out of place somewhere else, but in SoHo no one gave her a second look and she certainly didn’t seem concerned by her somewhat quirky appearance. Where was she going that evening, I wondered… (Spoiler alert: I ended up with some great photos for my portfolio piece, including several of her!)</p>

        <p>SoHo has become one of my favorite neighborhoods to hang-out with friends.  There is always something exciting waiting for me. Each time, I discover streets, stores, restaurants, and hidden corners I had not seen before and which then become part of my SoHo.  Sometimes I see a famous model. Other times there is an interesting pop-up shop which has just opened. SoHo also represents qualities I value, such as individuality, self-expression, open-mindedness, and inclusivity. It’s a place where people can be who they want to be and where Indie labels and small businesses can thrive. The energy is contagious and uplifting. There is never a dull moment in SoHo.</p>
